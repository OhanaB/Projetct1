Customer Insights for Targeted Marketing Strategies Analysis
Our analysis is focused on gaining insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and characteristics, with the goal of developing targeted marketing and advertising strategies that drive business growth in the marketing industry. To achieve this, we obtained data from a supermarket's customer records and conducted customer segmentation to group customers based on similarities within each category. This approach optimizes the significance of each customer segment to the business and allows for the modification of products to meet the distinct needs and behaviours of each segment, as well as addressing the concerns of different types of customers.

Can we identify any clusters of customers or segments to create a targeting strategy?
The analysis of our customer data has led us to identify two key segments that we believe would benefit from targeted marketing efforts. The first segment consists of couples with no children and a household income of $120k or more. The second segment is small families with 1-2 children. By focusing on these segments, we can tailor our marketing strategies and product offerings to better meet their needs and preferences. This approach will allow us to maximize the potential for growth and revenue within our customer base.
 
Conclusion
Based on the demographic and purchase behaviour data, we can segment customers into groups based on similarities within each category.
This approach optimizes the significance of each customer segment to the business and allows for the modification of products to meet the distinct needs and behaviours of each segment, as well as addressing the concerns of different types of customers.
Based on our analysis, we have identified a significant relationship between income and spending. Our data shows that customers with higher incomes tend to spend more. We also found that the volume of purchases is positively correlated with revenue, meaning that the more customers buy, the higher our revenue is likely to be.
However, we also noticed some limitations in the data. For example, our analysis was based solely on the amount spent in each category and did not consider the number of items purchased. This could affect the accuracy of the average amount spent per category. Additionally, we discovered that some data was missing, which resulted in a smaller dataset than originally anticipated. Therefore, while our findings provide valuable insights, they should be interpreted with caution due to these limitations.
